                She was the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the Ñoldor, and Eärwen, whose cousin was Lúthien. Her elder brothers were Finrod Felagund, Orodreth, Angrod, and Aegnor.

                He pursued the Ring for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it in Gollum's cave, within the Misty Mountains, and took it away. Inadvertently, Gollum would play a vital role in the ultimate 
                Quest of the Ring. The name Gollum was derived from the sound of his gurgling, choking cough.</p>

                White Council that for a time opposed the Dark Lord. But, in time, Saruman was overcome by lust for power and swore fealty to Sauron, becoming his puppet. 
                Having betrayed the Council and Free Peoples of the World, the White Wizard believed he could usurp his master's place as ruler of 
                Middle-earth, or at least become the true power behind his throne. During the Great War of the Ring, Saruman marshalled an army at 
                Isengard to both conquer Rohan on Sauron's behalf and try to seize the One Ring first without his knowledge.</p>
